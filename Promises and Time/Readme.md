# ‚è≥ Promises and Time | LeetCode 30 Days of JavaScript

## üîç Concept: Promises and Time
A **promise** in JavaScript is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It allows you to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous fashion and handle asynchronous operations more effectively.

### Key Takeaways:
- Promises provide a **cleaner syntax** for handling asynchronous operations.
- Useful for avoiding **callback hell**.
- They enable **chaining** of asynchronous operations and better **error handling**.

## üìÇ Future Programs
This folder will include more **promise-based** programs as part of the **LeetCode 30 Days of JavaScript** challenge, covering various use cases and patterns where promises can be applied.
