# 🚀 Closures | LeetCode 30 Days of JavaScript

## 🔍 Concept: Closures  
A **closure** in JavaScript is a function that has access to its own scope, the scope in which it was created, and the global scope. It allows inner functions to access variables from the outer function even after the outer function has completed execution.

### Key Takeaways:
- Closures provide **data encapsulation** and allow **private variables**.
- Useful for creating **function factories**.
- They enable **callback functions** and maintain **state** over time.

## 📂 Future Programs  
This folder will include more **closure-based** programs as part of the **LeetCode 30 Days of JavaScript** challenge, covering various use cases and patterns where closures can be applied.
