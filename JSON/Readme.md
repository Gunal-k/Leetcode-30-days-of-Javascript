# 🚀 JSON | LeetCode 30 Days of JavaScript

## 🔍 Concept: JSON  
**JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is often used for transmitting data in web applications.

### Key Takeaways:
- JSON is **text-based** and completely **language-independent**.
- It is commonly used for **API responses** and **configuration files**.
- JSON supports **objects**, **arrays**, **strings**, **numbers**, **booleans**, and **null**.

## 📂 Future Programs  
This folder will include more **JSON-based** programs as part of the **LeetCode 30 Days of JavaScript** challenge, covering various use cases and patterns where JSON can be applied.
