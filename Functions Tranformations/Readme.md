# 🚀 Function Transformations | LeetCode 30 Days of JavaScript

## 🔍 Concept: Function Transformations  
**Function transformations** in JavaScript involve creating new functions by combining, modifying, or enhancing existing functions. This concept is essential for functional programming and helps in writing more modular and reusable code.

### Key Takeaways:
- Function transformations enable **higher-order functions**.
- Useful for creating **composable functions**.
- They promote **code reusability** and **modularity**.

## 📂 Future Programs  
This folder will include more **function transformation-based** programs as part of the **LeetCode 30 Days of JavaScript** challenge, covering various use cases and patterns where function transformations can be applied.
